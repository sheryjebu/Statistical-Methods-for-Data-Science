Coursework Description: The aim of this assignment is to select the best regression model (from a candidate set of nonlinear regression models) that can well describe the relationship between several ‘simulated’ gene expression time-series data. Gene expression is one of the most important biological processes where information from a gene is used to synthesize a functional gene product, such as protein. The expression of a gene can be controlled (or regulated) by another gene or several other genes, through a gene product (protein) called transcription factor. Understanding how genes regulate each other, i.e. gene regulation, is important to investigate a complex diseases, and how cell respond to environmental stimuli.
